Ethereum-Based To-Do List dApp
Managing tasks is an essential part of daily life, and to-do list applications make it easier to organize and track them. Most task management applications today store data on centralized servers, which can sometimes lead to issues such as data loss, lack of transparency, or security concerns. To address these challenges, this project aims to build a decentralized to-do list application (dApp) using blockchain technology. This application stores tasks securely on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring they cannot be tampered with or lost. Although simple, this project demonstrates the core functionality of blockchain-based applications and their potential advantages over traditional centralized systems.
